### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

 Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to see how a program can
 help solve real-life problems. Part 2 focused on letting a user see if 
 parking at a certain time was allowed on a certain street. I believe 
 that this lab can be easily transferred into an online website that 
 uses real streets and data to help users identify if parking is 
 accessible at a certain time. This lab also helped me gain a better 
 idea of how functions work and how they can be very helpful if used correctly.

 * Lab 11

Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because a number guessing game was something that I had already completed in a prior lab, however in Lab 11 I was able to use classes and functions which made this program far higher quality and it gave me a better understanding on how classes work as well as making me realize the importance of object orientated programming.

 * Lab 9

Lab 9, part 1 was a favorite because I was able to filter specific results out such as the highest and lowest judge score which I thought was very interesting because this can be very helpful in data analysis, I also learned how to average the remaining scores which was new to me and is something that can also be extremely helpful in data analysis.
