### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

 Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to see how a program can
 help solve real-life problems. Part 2 focused on letting a user see if 
 parking at a certain time was allowed on a certain street. I believe 
 that this lab can be easily transferred into an online website that 
 uses real streets and data to help users identify if parking is 
 accessible at a certain time. This lab also helped me gain a better 
 idea of how functions work and how they can be very helpful if used correctly.
